# library-management-python
<br><br>
This is my mini and basic project in python using some basic libraries like pickle,os,random,time
<br>
This project manages and validates the books in the library.
<br>
<br>
This project was made in <b>Python 2.7<b> hence, It may not work well in the latest versions of python and some edit may be required.
